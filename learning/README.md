# Learning Module (Isolated From Product Code)

Purpose:
- build your first-principles understanding of this project,
- practice interview-ready explanations,
- and validate that you can reason from blank slate.

This directory is intentionally separate from runtime code. It mirrors product milestones but does not change product behavior.

## How To Use

1. Pick the module matching current delivery work.
2. Complete the "Explain From Scratch" section without opening project files.
3. Complete drills and score yourself using the rubric.
4. Compare your answer against actual implementation files.
5. Capture gaps in `learning/progress-journal.md`.

## Current Milestone Mapping

- Module 01: Day 1 (Architecture and Contracts)
- Module 02: Day 2 (Monorepo + Worker Topology)
- Module 03: Day 3 (API Worker + Validation Boundary)
- Module 04: Day 19 (Admin Dashboard Data Flow)
- Module 05: User Portal (Query UX + API Proxy Path)

## Definition of Learning Done

A module is complete when you can do all three:
- explain architecture and tradeoffs without reading code,
- debug a synthetic failure with a hypothesis-first approach,
- and answer 8/10 interview prompts with concrete examples.
